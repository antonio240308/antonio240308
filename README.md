## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jason and I am new to all of this, but here I am learning something new. 
I came to the IT by a less than *traditional* path. I was a __Massage Therapist__ for 20 years when the world **LOST ITS MIND** and everything shut down. 
I am currently working in a data center and am really learning a lot. I have done my fair share of racking and stacking and am ready to move into a new role.
I am studying for the AZ-104 certification and am working on becoming a Cloud Security Engineer.
I am working a few projects along the way. One being from GPS and the Learn 2 Cloud website she made. It seems to be a good place to start. 
I __*LOVE*__ to play basketball in my free time and have a great group of guys I play with. I also enjoy getting on my Harley Fat Boy and going for a ride. There is nothing better when you want to clear your head!
There is I'm sure a lot more I could say but for now, I think I'll leave it at that.
